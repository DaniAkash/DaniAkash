It all started with [3D Pinball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMZwb05pPnI) on a dusty Windows XP computer in a Xerox shop. One game, and I was hooked. Computers have fascinated me ever since, leading to an engineering degree in computer science (and a mildly concerning collection of [video games](https://www.ign.com/playlist/Hunte%D0%AF/library/beat))

These days, I’m an enthusiastic **worldbuilder** in every sense. I love learning about the big stuff that makes our world tick – from **global economics** 🌍 to **particle physics** 🧬. My classroom? Books, documentaries, and the endless stream of educational YouTube rabbit holes. I’m equally into imaginary worlds too, so you’ll find me lost in [anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/piratehunter) and [games](https://psnprofiles.com/hunter_vrtx) like _One Piece_, _Evangelion_, and _Tekken_ 🎮

## What I’m Up To Now

Today, I’m a programmer, engineering manager, and an occasional educator. When I’m not coding, I’m teaching others how to kickstart their tech careers and find their own path in this ever-evolving digital world 🚀
