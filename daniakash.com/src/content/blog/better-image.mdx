Introducing a [better image component](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/react-native-better-image) for React Native!

<PostImage

  _Image loading with better-image library_
</PostImage>

React Native only includes a basic image component. However, I always needed two very important functionalities on the Image component:

- A **fallback image** if the original source fails to load
- **Progressive image loading** (especially for banners & cover images)

So I customized the existing `<Image/>` component and have been using this `<BetterImage/>` component in my projects. Today, I'm open-sourcing my component to receive feedbacks & ideas from the community.

Do try it out at [react-native-toolkit/react-native-better-image](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/react-native-better-image)

I have also created a storybook with detailed docs at [betterimage.netlify.app](https://betterimage.netlify.app/)

What other features do you think are essential for the Image component? Share your ideas & I'll be happy to help üëç
