React Native Responsive Dimensions have been updated to version 3.1.0 with full typescript support & a whole bunch of new utilities quickly check out the new release at [github](https://github.com/DaniAkash/react-native-responsive-dimensions)

First published three years ago as a simple utility to resize some views based on the device's screen size, responsive dimensions quickly became one of the favourite tools for my colleagues and many react native developers. I was updating it once a year with a few new things like the [responsive hooks](https://github.com/DaniAkash/react-native-responsive-dimensions/releases/tag/3.0.0) last year. But this update is quite important!

I recently worked with [Rachel Nabors](https://dev.to/rachelnabors) on React Native [Component Docs Drive](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/1579) where while documenting the actual react native's inbuilt [dimensions](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/1671) module, I realized Responsive Dimensions has a great potential to simplify application development for foldables and react-native-web apps.

With this new update, Responsive Dimensions now have

- Separate utilities for Responsive "window" & "screen" sizes (screen sizes will be useful while working with foldables)
- New responsive screen size hooks
- `useDimensionsChange` hook to let your application respond to dimension changes

See the [release notes](https://github.com/DaniAkash/react-native-responsive-dimensions/releases/tag/3.1.0) for a full list of changes and also checkout the example projects at [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@daniakash/responsive-dimensions) & [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-native-responsive-dimensions-hooks-2cqm8)
