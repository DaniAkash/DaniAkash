I always come across a scenario where my UI needs a triangle view. Also I needed fine control over all aspects of the triangle view. Hence I built [@react-native-toolkit/triangle](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/triangle) view based on the well known CSS trick to create triangles on the web.

As my requirements grew, I was adding more features to the library and now it supports almost all possible triangles you need. Hence I'm open sourcing it today for general use.

  style="width:100%; height: 500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="triangle"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"

I initially used [react-native-triangle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-triangle) but it's configuration is fairly limited and I couldn't control many of the triangle properties. Hence this library became a necessity.

Also, I have started to work on open sourcing all the libraries I built for react native over the years for my personal projects. Will be slowly moving them over to [React Native Toolkit](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit). Stay tuned for future updates!
