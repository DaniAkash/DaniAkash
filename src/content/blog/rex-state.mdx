## Introducing [Rex State](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/rex-state) v1.0

I initially built rex-state as a state management library, however, since it was using the Context API it wasn't very efficient with handling re-renders.

But then its another feature became more prominent. It can easily convert any hook into a shared state!

Focusing on this functionality, Today I'm releasing Rex State 1.0. This tool is easy to use and will work with your existing hooks.

## Usage

Add rex-state to your project

```sh
yarn add rex-state

# or

npm i rex-state
```

Consider you have the following counter hook Ôπ£

```jsx
const useCounterHook = (initialCount) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount || 0);

  const increaseCount = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decreaseCount = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return {
    count,
    increaseCount,
    decreaseCount,
  };
};
```

You can use rex-state to create a provider and a shared hook using the following code Ôπ£

```jsx
import { createRexStore } from "rex-state";

const { useStore: useCounter, RexProvider: CountProvider } =
  createRexStore(useCounterHook);
```

Wrap your application inside the `CountProvider` Ôπ£

```jsx
export default function App() {
  // Starting off with an initial count of 10
  return (
    <CountProvider value={10}>
      <CountDisplay />
      <Controls />
    </CountProvider>
  );
}
```

Now you can use `useCounter` hook inside both `<CountDisplay/>` & `<Controls/>` components. When the count changes in the `<Controls/>` component, it will cause the `<CountProvider/>` to re-render & will also update the `<CountDisplay/>` component.

This is based on the React.Context API. I have written a detailed page on its [performance](https://rex-state.netlify.app/?path=/story/intro-performance--page) & when to use it in your application.

Following is a working codesandbox of the counter app Ôπ£
