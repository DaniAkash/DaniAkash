If you were following the news last month, you probably would have come across how jQuery received a new [security patch](https://blog.jquery.com/2019/04/) which addresses [the prototype pollution flaw](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006). It is a huge deal, given how 74 percent of all internet sites use the vulnerable version of the library!

> Now before we all panic, prototype pollution isn't exactly an easy vulnerability to be exploited. It needs a fair amount of knowledge on the application architecture to be exploited. This also means all those open source Javascript frameworks and projects in Github are at a huge risk of being exploited.
